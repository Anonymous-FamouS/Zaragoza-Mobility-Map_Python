# Zaragoza Urban Mobility Planning Tool

This project builds an **interactive urban mobility planning platform** for Zaragoza, Spain.  
It combines **cycling infrastructure**, **bus routes**, **tram routes**, and spatial layers of **walking and cycling infrastructure gaps** into a single Folium map.  

In addition to the multimodal map, the project includes an **emissions analysis module**, where district-level emissions data is processed, aggregated, and visualised through charts and spatial overlays. Together, these modules create a powerful exploratory tool for mobility and sustainability planning in Zaragoza.

## üîç Overview

The repository provides:

- **Interactive Folium Map**:  
  - Base maps (OpenStreetMap, CartoDB, Stamen).  
  - Layers for Zaragoza‚Äôs **bike lanes**, **bus routes (GTFS)**, and **tram routes (GTFS)**.  
  - **Walking and cycling network gap analysis** using OpenStreetMap data (OSMnx).  
  - Toggle controls to enable/disable infrastructure layers.

- **Emissions Analysis Module**:  
  - District-level aggregation of transport emissions.  
  - Coverage statistics for walking/cycling networks.  
  - Visualisations: bar charts, stacked bars, pie charts, scatter plots.

- **Extensions / Side Modules**:  
  - Accessibility: stop coverage and centroids.  
  - Legend customisation and district label testing.  
  - Export-ready multipanel graphics.

## üìä Aim

The main purpose of this project is to create a **planning support tool** that helps stakeholders and researchers explore:  
- Where Zaragoza‚Äôs transport infrastructure is concentrated.  
- Where **gaps** exist in walking and cycling networks.  
- How emissions vary spatially across districts.  
- How multimodal integration (bus, tram, cycling, walking) can inform sustainable mobility planning.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Main Interactive Map
- **Basemaps**: OpenStreetMap, CartoDB Positron, Stamen Toner for different visual styles.  
- **Cycling Infrastructure**: Shapefiles from Zaragoza Open Data, styled in blue.  
- **Bus Routes**: Extracted from GTFS feed (`routes.txt`, `shapes.txt`) ‚Üí drawn as orange polylines.  
- **Tram Routes**: GTFS tram routes parsed ‚Üí drawn as purple polylines.  
- **Walking & Cycling Gaps**:  
  - Detected using **OSMnx** street graph extraction.  
  - Compared available walking/cycling edges against coverage radii of stops and key destinations.  
  - Highlighted in **red (walking gaps)** and **green (cycling gaps)**.  
- **Interactivity**:  
  - Popups for metadata (`route_id`, `route_long_name`, etc. from GTFS).  
  - Layer control for toggling visibility of infrastructure types.  
  - Custom legend for map readability.  

**Finding**: Walking and cycling gaps often coincided with **lower-density areas** and were **negatively correlated with bus stop density**. Districts with more transit coverage showed fewer walking/cycling accessibility gaps.

### 2. Emissions Analysis Module
- **District Aggregation**: Joined emissions CSV with GeoJSON boundaries (`district_id` join).  
- **Coverage Metrics**: Cycling/walking infrastructure km per district divided by district area.  
  - Formula:  
    ```python
    coverage_ratio = infra_length_km / district_area_km2
    ```
- **Charts**:  
  - **Bar chart**: emissions per district.  
  - **Stacked bar**: transport vs non-transport contributions.  
  - **Pie chart**: modal split of transport-related emissions.  
  - **Scatter plot**:  
    - *X-axis*: emissions per capita.  
    - *Y-axis*: cycling/walking infrastructure coverage.  
    - *Formula for correlation*:  
      ```python
      correlation = df['emissions_pc'].corr(df['coverage_ratio'])
      ```
    - Result: **negative correlation** ‚Üí higher cycling/walking coverage linked to lower emissions.  
- **Composite Output**:  
  - Multi-panel (2√ó2) layout created with Matplotlib.  
  - District emissions choropleth overlaid on Folium map.  

**Finding**: Districts with higher cycling and walking infrastructure coverage tended to show **lower per-capita emissions**. This highlighted the **potential emissions benefit of active travel infrastructure investment**.

### 3. Accessibility & Side Modules
- **Accessibility Analysis**:  
  - Measured coverage of **hospitals, universities, and shopping centres** within 800m (walk) and 2.5km (cycle).  
  - Formula:  
    ```python
    accessibility = (covered_destinations / total_destinations) * 100
    ```
  - Findings: Accessibility gaps strongest at **suburban edges**, especially for universities and hospitals.  

- **Centrality Measures**:  
  - Graph-based metrics applied to road/cycle/walk networks using NetworkX:  
    - **Betweenness Centrality**:  
      ```python
      nx.betweenness_centrality(G, weight="length")
      ```  
      ‚Üí Identified network bottlenecks.  
    - **Closeness Centrality**:  
      ```python
      nx.closeness_centrality(G, distance="length")
      ```  
      ‚Üí Highlighted most accessible hubs.  
    - **Degree Centrality**:  
      ```python
      nx.degree_centrality(G)
      ```  
      ‚Üí Showed connectivity density of nodes.  

  - Findings: High-centrality nodes often coincided with **tram interchanges** and **major road junctions**, reinforcing their importance for multimodal access.  

- **Export Options**:  
  - Static PNGs (matplotlib).  
  - Interactive Folium HTML maps with legends and popups.
